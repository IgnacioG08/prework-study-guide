# Early Stages of Coding Bootcamp

## Description

- I am motivated to create this study guide as a resource to aid myself and others in the begining stages of coding. This guide was an excellent start to the next 6 months and will hopefully serve as a reminder of my first project once Im doing much more intricate coding.
- I built this project as a basis of my abilities or lack of so that once I have spent many hours coding I cant appreciate the first step that I took in the process.
- This project is an opportunity for beginners in the coding bootcamp to read and perhaps take something away from my notes that they can then build on in they're studies.
- The project was a valuable exercise in the coding languages that I will be immersed in within the coming weeks. It has given a minor peek into what goes into being a professional coder.

This study guide can be utilized as a resource for any beginning coder who has taken the first steps into learning a skill that will develop them into a professional programmer. Although not intensive this study guide can be examined as a first project. Each section is divided into its respective categories, where someone can visit for some basic notes on subjects ranging from: HTML, CSS, JavaScipt, and Git. In addition to these notes we can also open the DevTools console so that we can observe JavaScript running.
