        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <u1>
          <li>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</li>
          <li>HTML elements work together to build the structure of a webpage and provide a framework that makes it easy for a user to navigate the webpage</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user</li>
          <li>DOCTYPE tells the browser what type of doucment is being opened</li>
          <li>Lang=en in quotations tells the browser the language to use</li>
          <li>HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element</li>
          <li>Metadata is data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users. Metadata is typically not seen by users, but it contains important information about accessibility, search engines, and performance</li>
          <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements. If there are three elements nested inside of a body element, those three nested elements are known as child elements</li>
          <li>The element that holds all the children -- in this case, the body element is known as the parent element</li>
          <li>An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag</li>
          <li>A tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets</li>

     <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <u1>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and an external CSS style sheet</li>
          <li>Inline CSS is appropriate when a developer wants to style an element directly within the HTML file</li>
          <li>Internal Style Sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file</li>
          <li>External CSS style sheet is the preffered option in most cases due to it allowing CSS files to be kept in a seperate file</li>
